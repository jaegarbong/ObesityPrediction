<h1> OBESITY PREDICTION</h1>

This application is built based out of a kaggle competition found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/srsses/multiclass-classification-obesity).

The application is meant to predict the state of health of a person based on several input factors. Apart from physiological factors like age, height and weight, lifestyle factors like the following are also considered:

1. FAVC: Frequent consumption of high-calorie food. This refers to how often an individual eats foods that are high in calories. Frequent consumption of high-calorie foods can contribute to weight gain and obesity.

2. FCVC: Frequency of consumption of vegetables. This refers to how often an individual eats vegetables. Vegetables are low in calories and high in nutrients, so eating them regularly can help with weight management and overall health.

3. NCP: Number of main meals. This refers to how many main meals an individual eats per day. There is no single "ideal" number of main meals, but some studies suggest that eating more frequent, smaller meals may be beneficial for weight management.

4. CAEC: Consumption of food between meals. This refers to how often an individual eats snacks or other foods between meals. Frequent snacking can contribute to excess calorie intake and weight gain.

5. SMOKE: Smokes (yes or no). This refers to whether or not an individual smokes cigarettes. Smoking is a major risk factor for many health problems, including obesity, heart disease, and cancer.

6. CH2O: Consumption of water daily. This refers to how much water an individual drinks per day. Drinking plenty of water is important for overall health and may also help with weight management.

7. SCC: Calories consumption monitoring. This refers to whether or not an individual tracks their calorie intake. Calorie tracking can be a helpful tool for weight management, as it allows individuals to be more aware of how much they are eating.

8. FAF: Physical activity frequency. This refers to how often an individual engages in physical activity. Regular physical activity is essential for maintaining a healthy weight and reducing the risk of chronic diseases.

9. TUE: Time using technology devices. This refers to how much time an individual spends using electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets. Excessive screen time has been linked to a number of health problems, including obesity.

10. CALC: Consumption of alcohol. This refers to how often and how much alcohol an individual drinks. Excessive alcohol consumption can contribute to weight gain and other health problems.

11. MTRANS: Mode of transportation. This refers to how an individual gets around, such as by car, public transportation, bicycle, or walking. Active forms of transportation, such as walking and cycling, can help with weight management.
